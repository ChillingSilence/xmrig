XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX miner. Binary builds are available for Windows, Linux & OSX.

This build has had alternative and unneccesary algorithms removed, leaving just RandomX for CPU-based mining, along with defaults pointed to DigiByte pools. This is done to simplify mining on DigiByte for new users, while advanced users can still use either the [original binaries](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) or build from source if they so desire. The dev-address has also been updated to point to DigiByte in support of future mining software (Such as 1-click mining wrappers, mobile-mining etc).
